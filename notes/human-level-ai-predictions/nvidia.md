# NVIDIA

## The Business Model

NVIDIA designs AI chips but doesn't manufacture them - TSMC does (this is called "fabless"). NVIDIA sits between:

- **TSMC** (manufacturer) - bears the capital cost of building fabs
- **Hyperscalers** (customers: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) - bear the cost of deploying AI infrastructure

NVIDIA just designs the chips and collects **73% gross margins**. This is an extraordinarily profitable position.

## Market Dominance

Per MLQ.ai (an investor research site): [source](https://mlq.ai/research/ai-chips/)

- NVIDIA holds 70-95% of the AI chip market (citing Mizuho Securities)
- NVIDIA owns 95%+ of the _training_ market specifically
- Hyperscalers are spending $380+ billion on AI infrastructure in 2025

## Financial Position (Q3 FY2026)

[Source: NVIDIA Investor Relations, Nov 19, 2025](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx)

**The cash pile:** NVIDIA has $60.6B cash vs $7.5B debt = **$53B net cash**. They could pay off all debt 8x over. The cash mostly just accumulates - they do some stock buybacks and R&D spending, but the business generates cash faster than they spend it.

**Recent growth:**

- Revenue: $57.0B (up 62% YoY)
- Data Center: $51.2B (up 66% YoY) - 90% of total revenue
- Net income: $31.9B
- Free cash flow: $22.1B (just Q3 alone)

**Q4 FY26 Outlook:**

- Revenue expected: $65.0B (+/- 2%)
- Gross margins expected: ~75%

## Valuation: What the Stock Price Implies (Feb 2026)

| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Market Cap                           | $4.65 trillion | [companiesmarketcap.com](https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/) |
| Stock Price                          | $186           | [fullratio.com](https://fullratio.com/stocks/nasdaq-nvda/pe-ratio)         |
| P/E Ratio (last 4 quarters)          | 47             | [public.com](https://public.com/stocks/nvda/pe-ratio)                      |
| Forward P/E (based on predictions)   | 27             | [stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/statistics/)     |
| Earnings per share (last 4 quarters) | $4.06          | [fullratio.com](https://fullratio.com/stocks/nasdaq-nvda/pe-ratio)         |

**What 47x P/E means:** You're paying $186 for $4.06 of annual earnings per share. At that rate, it would take 47 years to "earn back" your investment if growth stopped. Compare to a boring utility at 12x or a bank at 10x.

**Why pay 47x?** The bet is that earnings grow fast enough to shrink that payback period. Wall Street expects $320B revenue in FY2027, up from $213B in FY2026 (~50% growth). [source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/05/3-bold-nvidia-predictions-for-2026/) The forward P/E of 27 (vs trailing 47) implies analysts expect earnings to nearly double.

**What's priced in:**

- Continued 50%+ annual growth
- NVIDIA maintains ~90% AI chip market share
- Hyperscalers keep spending aggressively on AI
- Pricing power holds (73% margins continue)

## Valuation Decomposition: What Are You Betting On?

NVIDIA's stock price conflates two separate bets:

1. **AI demand continues** (total market grows)
2. **NVIDIA keeps its dominance** (market share + margins hold)

If you care about NVIDIA as a signal for AI industry health, you need to separate these.

**Breaking down the $186 share price:**

| Component                | Value | % of Price | What it represents                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Baseline NVIDIA          | ~$45  | 25%        | Gaming, professional graphics (pre-AI business)        |
| Competitive moat premium | ~$65  | 35%        | NVIDIA's 90% market share, 73% margins, CUDA ecosystem |
| AI demand growth bet     | ~$75  | 40%        | Expectation that hyperscaler AI spending keeps growing |

**Why 20x P/E as the "mature company" benchmark?**

P/E ratios roughly correlate with expected growth:

| P/E Range | What it implies                             | Examples                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 10-15x    | Declining or cyclical                       | Banks, old industrials      |
| 15-20x    | Mature, stable                              | Utilities, consumer staples |
| 20-25x    | Slow-growth tech                            | Microsoft pre-AI, Cisco     |
| 30-50x    | High growth (20%+ earnings growth expected) | Most big tech               |
| 50x+      | Hypergrowth or speculative                  | Current NVIDIA              |

I use 20x as the baseline because even without AI, NVIDIA would still be a strong tech company (gaming, CUDA ecosystem, brand). That's better than a utility but not a growth stock.

**How I estimated the breakdown:**

1. **Baseline ($45):** Pre-AI (FY2023) NVIDIA had ~$4B profit. At 20x P/E × $4B = $80B market cap ÷ 24.3B shares = **$3/share**. But gaming has grown since then, so generously estimate 10-15x that = **~$45/share**.

2. **Current earnings value ($82):** Over the last 4 quarters, earnings were $99B ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/net-income)). At a mature-company P/E of 20x: $99B × 20 = $2T market cap ÷ 24.3B shares = **$82/share**. This is what NVIDIA would be worth if growth stopped today.

3. **Total growth premium (~$104):** $186 (actual) - $82 (no-growth value) = **$104/share** in growth expectations.

4. **Splitting the growth premium:** The $104 premium combines two bets: NVIDIA-specific dominance and total AI market growth. I split it roughly 60/40:
   - **Competitive moat (~$65):** NVIDIA's ecosystem lock-in (CUDA), margins, market share
   - **AI demand growth (~$75):** Pure bet that hyperscalers keep spending on AI infrastructure

   (This split is a judgment call - the market doesn't separate these explicitly.)

**Implications:**

- If AI demand collapses → stock could fall 75-90% (back to $20-45)
- If AI demand continues but NVIDIA loses share → stock could fall 30-50% (to $100-130)
- If both hold → current price is justified

**As a signal for AI:** ~40% of NVIDIA's current price ($75/share, or ~$1.8T of market cap) is a pure bet on continued AI infrastructure demand growth. This is the portion that tells you what the market thinks about AI's future.

## What Growth Is Priced In?

Working forward from the current price to see what growth the market expects:

**Starting point (Feb 2026):**

- Stock price: $186/share
- Market cap: $4.65 trillion
- Earnings (last 4 quarters): ~$100B
- P/E: 47x

**The implied trajectory:**

For the current price to be justified, investors need roughly 10% annual returns. Working forward:

| Year | Earnings | Growth | P/E (compressing) | Market Cap |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Now  | $100B    | -      | 47x               | $4.7T      |
| +1   | $150B    | +50%   | 40x               | $6.0T      |
| +2   | $210B    | +40%   | 33x               | $6.9T      |
| +3   | $270B    | +30%   | 27x               | $7.3T      |
| +4   | $325B    | +20%   | 23x               | $7.5T      |
| +5   | $360B    | +10%   | 20x               | $7.2T      |

**The bet:** Earnings nearly quadruple from ~$100B → ~$360B over 5 years, then grow at normal rates (5%) thereafter.

**Sanity check:** If you buy at $186 today and this plays out, in 5 years the stock is worth ~$295/share ($7.2T ÷ 24.3B shares). That's a 10% annual return - reasonable for a high-growth stock.

**If growth disappoints:** Say earnings only double to $200B instead of quadrupling. At 20x P/E that's $4T market cap, or ~$165/share - an 11% decline from today.

This roughly aligns with Wall Street analyst projections of [35% revenue CAGR over the next 4 years](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/nvda/analyst-estimates), though analyst estimates tend to be optimistic.

# Summary

NVIDIA the _company_ is rock-solid ($53B net cash, 73% margins, dominant position). But NVIDIA the _stock_ is a bet on hypergrowth. Investors - not the company - are the ones leveraged against growth expectations, betting that business for NVIDIA specifically (not competitors like Google / AMD) will roughly quadruple from current levels. If that demand doesn't materialize, the stock can fall by as much as 50% even while the underlying business remains healthy.
