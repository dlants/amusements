Hey! My name is Denis Lantsman. I've done some cool things in my technology career:

- Machine Learning and Search Quality Engineering
- Full-Stack Software Engineering
- Implementing a browser-native [Domain Specific Language](https://www.desmos.com/api/v1.9/docs/index.html#document-latexexpressions) for building [interactive math experiences](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5b96a08fda673f5e6a38b7a0), and a supporting integrated development environment.
- Infrastructure / Dev-Ops
- Developing hiring processes, mentoring, and shaping an awesome engineering team.

These days I work on building [teacher.desmos.com](https://teacher.desmos.com).

I'm interested in many things!

💪🏻 I'm an avid climber (boulderer), and I really enjoy learning about the science of sports and skill acquisition, and applying it to my training. My favorite resources are the [perception and action podcast](https://perceptionaction.com/), [strongerbyscience](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/), and especially their [art and science of lifting books](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/art-and-science/).

🔪 Cooking. I love learning from folks like [Kenji](https://www.youtube.com/@JKenjiLopezAlt) and [Internet Shaquille](https://www.youtube.com/@InternetShaquille).

🐕 Dog training. I have a very smart, but also very challenging dog. I got really into dog training while trying to figure out ways for us to coexist. I really love [Hannah Branigan's work](https://www.hannahbranigan.dog/).

🕳️ Absurdism / existentialism. Though I prefer to find humor in it, like [Rational Funk](https://www.youtube.com/@RationalFunk).

📝 Self-evidently, I enjoy writing.

The whole point of this blog is to create a community. Each post is like a message in a bottle, floating in the ocean (oSEOan ?), waiting to be found. So if you connected with anything in this blog, please treat me with a note. I'll find it very reinforcing.
