# Why did I make the site?

Overall I’m hoping to push people towards more sport-specific forms of training. I want people to walk away from the site asking themselves questions like:



If I want to hangboard, should I just hang max weight on a 20mm edge using whatever grip? Or should I use my weakest grip between the full / half / open? Or should I train various combinations of fingers? Do typewriters on the wall? Or should I just regularly climb on overhanging crimps?



If I feel like my posterior chain is weak, should I do deadlifts? Or 1-h kettlebell swings? Or glute bridges? Or nordic curls? Or do one-handed reaches on juggy holds on overhanging terrain?



Some more specific ideas follow:

## Training for the test

The main reason I wanted to put this site together is to use it as a timely place to deliver a message. What I see many climbers do, and what I have done myself, is to go - “oh, my 1rm weighted pullup is lower than the average for my grade. I guess that means I should do weighted pullups until I bring it up to the average, or even a little bit above, and that will mean that I will climb a higher grade”.

I am here to tell you that this is not the way. Your training and testing don’t have to look the same! In fact, most likely your training and testing should be quite different from each other.

What you’re doing is training for the test, not training for climbing. Climbers need to be able to pull with narrow grips and wide grips. We need to pull on holds overhead, in front of us, and to the side of us. We need to pull using a variety of finger positions and wrist angles. We need to coordinate pulling with different amounts of force in each hand.

Your pullup should be the outcome of your training, not the training itself. ROM = range of motion.

When climbers become strong, they become strong at all of these different pulling movements. That incidentally also includes the weighted pullup movement.

However, when you train the weighted pullup (especially at the expense of doing a more diverse set of pulling movements on the wall), what you are doing is training for the test. You’re developing a narrow pulling movement, which will have limited transfer to all of those other pulling positions that are needed for climbing.

> At least you should do like a pullup, and then change your hand position. At least something like this. You could do a pullup, then do a rollover, then a windshield wiper…

> …one hand you have wrapped around a pullup bar. Perfect. Your thumb is supported. This pullup bar is meant to be pulled on. It’s man-made. Your other hand is in a typical franken-euro pocket situation. Like one pocket is maybe a little bit crumbling at the edge of it. The other one is moist. Then the one for your ring finger is maybe totally out of the way, so you don’t know how to load it. So what do you think your brain gives you permission to do? With a pullup bar it will give you an OK - all muscles fire. There’s nothing that can go wrong so your brain will allow you to pull on this pullup bar. In the franken-euro setup your brain will be like wait a moment. I’m not allowing you to pull. I’m not crazy, I’m not risking your tendons or a terrible fall. So if you ask me, maximum strength is what your brain gives you permission to do.

## comparing apples to apples

Another trend I’ve seen in many strength testing applications is aggregating climbers into essentially two categories - male vs female. Does it really make sense for a 6’2, 185lb guy with a -4 ape index and skinny fingers to compare himself to a 5’8, 135lb guy with a +4 ape index and banana fingers? Sure the strength-weight ratio is an adjustment that we can make there, but we actually don’t have to. With a large-enough pool of data, you can compare yourself with people that are similar to you.

Revisiting the “training for the test” section, are you comparing yourself with people who specifically train these movements, or who “just climb” and only use the test for evaluation?

Since so many folks are doing weighted pullup training these days, we all look a lot more like the narrow-peak “training for the test” graph on the right. Consequently, our pullup is inflated relative to what we actually need to climb our grade. Then other people who don’t specifically train the pullup compare themselves against these numbers and see that they’re below average. But they’re actually probably above average in the remainder of the movement space where it actually matters.

People who train a 1rm or a 2rm movement even for a short time will get better at it really quickly, because they will become more used to expressing their strength in that level of intensity and rep ranges via neurological adaptation. However, these rapid improvements on the test generally won’t translate into actually climbing better.

On the site, I really emphasized “time you’ve spent training this measure” as a way to encourage people to compare themselves with others who haven’t necessarily spent as much time training the specific test measure.

## public data

The final goal of this project is to make this data easily available to everyone. If you want to test yourself to guide your training, you can! If you are a coach and you’d like to test your athletes, but you don’t have access to a large dataset to compare your athletes against, hopefully this will grow to the size that it’s useful. I’m also going to make the entire db available to anyone who is interested in doing research on these measurements.

# What should training for climbing look like?

## fingers

Always training on a flat edge, in the same grip position, makes for a fragile grip. If the grip is slightly at a different angle, or there’s torsion on your fingers, or the fingers don’t quite stack up as well, your training won’t transfer.

- For my earlier thinking on this, see this [blog post](https://dlants.me/climbing-ed-capacity.html)
- For most people, warm up on the hangboard, but do most of your training on the wall.
  - Prime the grip with a few high-intensity movements. If you’re feeling strong that day, start your session by projecting a fingery boulder.
  - Or try 1-h pulls on holds in the gym.
  - Or try type-writers on holds in the gym.
- If you really want to use the hangboard, introduce variety. As long as you get enough intensity, you’ll still get stronger!
  - use a variety of grip types. this doesn’t mean just open/crimp/drag/full-crimp.
  - leaving out some fingers places a lot more stress on the lumbricals, for example, which will result in a much more stable grip.
  - Try different hangboards/edges. Try 1-h pulls on holds in the gym.
- Do pull-ups or swings, rather than hangs, on small edges. This is probably more relevant than deadhangs, due to the increased demand on stabilization.
## pulling

- get on the wall and pull. Do one-handed rows on overhangs. You can do a different motion each time, as long as you get close to failure within 5 or so reps.
# Preempting objections

## Hangboarding and weighted pullups are such a staple and they have worked for so many climbers, it would be silly to tell people not to do them.

As I wrote about in [[Ecological Dynamics and Capacity Training in Climbing]], hangboarding can be quite dangerous for repetitive stress injury. Loading the same tissue in the same way with increasing load, on top of climbing on that same tissue (which often doesn’t get counted towards the overall load), is a recipe for hurting yourself and many many climbers hurt themselves hangboarding.

For most climbers, you can achieve a more robust grip by attending to the intensity of your climbing, using the protocol I describe above (warm up, prime your fingers for pulling, then get on a hard fingery project). You will still get stronger, but won’t risk injury. Your hangboard numbers won’t be as impressive, but you’ll probably climb harder.

Achieving overload on the hangboard is much, much easier than it is on the wall. This is why so many people are drawn to it as a training tool. I think a very prudent approach would be to use the hangboard to learn what maximal effort *feels like*, and then try and replicate that feeling using your on-the-wall training.
