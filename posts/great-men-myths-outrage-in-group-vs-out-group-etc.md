Ludicity blog, theprimaegen, reddit, hacker news. Outrage.

Fahrenheit 451, 1984, brave new world. These have the same quality. The protagonist is the only one who “sees” the world for what it is, and sets himself apart - almost as a different species. There is the same sort of division of the protagonist and the audience vs the world. The audience and the protagonist are on the same side. They see the evil of the world for what it is. And those other people don’t get it. They are less-than.

In-group vs out-group. Part of what draws me to this culture is that I get to feel like part of the in-group. I can see things that others can’t. I can set myself apart from *them*, and feel righteous indignation. These communities are spaces where people can come together and extract revenge. You might be in the out-group in your corporate life, but here is a space where you are part of the in-group, and can exact your revenge through public outrage, mockery and shaming.

And there is something really appealing about that, especially when one feels that these people really deserve it! They’ve weaponized incompetence. They fatten themselves on the labor of others, all while making life miserable for those unfortunate enough to fall in their sphere of influence. When you hear of a CTO collecting a fat check while parading around the thought-leadership space and getting accolades for their accomplishments, all based on lies and exploitation of the true hard-working engineers, it really feels just, and cathartic, and fair, to tar and feather that person in a public square.

# In-group, out-group

We have to recognize that the in-group vs out-group is a powerful part of our psychology. This is a mechanism within our brains that has function and utility. By creating an out-group and dehumanizing the other, we feel comfortable (or maybe even enjoy) shunning, shaming, and harming them.

There are downsides to this, of course.

One is that we must inhabit two worlds. The corporate world, and the blog world. I think there’s risk of one bleeding into the other — bringing that righteous fury into your workplace is probably not something that is advisable for most people.

Another is that the blog world is a world of myths. People can, and do, smooth over the sharp corners. Reality is much more messy and complicated. And consequently, when you do bring that fury into your life, you can end up taking it out on people who really don’t deserve it. Yes, maybe the Australian company that the author of the Ludicity blog worked at was entirely pathological, but is your company the same?

You mention the cathartic appeal of public shaming. There's actually some tension in the research about whether venting anger is genuinely cathartic or whether it reinforces and amplifies the anger. Brad Bushman's work suggests the latter—that "letting it out" often increases rather than decreases aggressive feelings. The satisfaction is real, but it may be more like scratching an itch that makes it itchier.

Third, defining an out-group is a double edged sword. When we create an out-group, I think we must necessarily deny and cut off those parts of ourselves that attribute us to the out group. I am not like one of those people. At worst, the internal experience of righteous anger is that of blind self-butchery. The anger applied to others reflected inwards at those parts of ourselves that we deem inhuman.

One thing that might strengthen this section: the research also shows that in-group/out-group thinking isn't just about hostility. It's also about *reduced empathy* and *moral disengagement*. Albert Bandura's work on moral disengagement mechanisms is relevant here—things like euphemistic labeling, diffusion of responsibility, dehumanization. These are the cognitive moves that let ordinary people participate in collective harm while maintaining a positive self-image.





What sort of spaces do I want to create and participate in? I really enjoy [https://jvns.ca/](https://jvns.ca/) - there is humility, encouragement, and actual joy and play. I want to invite people to program, especially people who may not have access to it, or may not feel welcome in the spaces that currently exist. I want them to feel how creative and fun it can be. I want to try and fail publicly, to be allowed to be lazy and not read the manual. To make mistakes, to misunderstand, to be slow about getting something.

I also don’t want to position this as the “right” way to be. People find comfort in being able to vent their frustrations, and that’s fine. I definitely consume a lot of this content too and I can see the appeal. But I do want to push back on the fact that it’s currently a monoculture.

I think this also brings me around to thinking about existentialism and the absurd. I don’t think there’s a universal Good or Right that a position can be grounded on. And situations like this - where there is a villain, an aggressor, a party that is acting in bad faith, is lying, etc… is where this sort of absurdist position tends to stumble.

My view is that there is no universal morality, and that human conceptions of what is good and moral are local heuristics. When one tries to extend them via systematic, logical frameworks, they tend to break down and cease to feel moral. At the same time, I think there are two things that we can ground on. First, there’s the universality of the human frame. Yes, it’s incoherent and local, but it is some common ground. Different people with different brains may experience it differently, but I think we have at least some space to explore - some dimensions to play with.

The second is the idea of choice. If there’s no universal right or wrong, we can decide what is right for us. Whether through our own unique genetics, biology, path dependence or whatever else, we arrive at a certain world view and position. And I think we can own that and find meaning in that. So I like inviting people into software engineering, I like extending humanity to others, and I am really wary of projects of segmenting people into an in-group and an out-group or spaces of righteous fury, indignation and public shaming. I feel like there’s something wrong with that. It’s not healthy.
