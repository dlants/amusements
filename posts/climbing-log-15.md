These were the weeks of Nov 14 and 21, the first two weeks of cycle 4. Both weeks followed the following schedule:

# lazy fingers

I’ve been trying to do density hangs, and this has confirmed for me something that I’ve had kicking around in my head for a while, ever since listening to the [Ned Feehally episode of the Nugget](https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/ned-feehally).

I noticed that my climbing performance and my hangs didn’t really get negatively impacted by my index finger injury. In fact, the week after I first injured it, I still managed to hang bodyweight in front-3 for 7 seconds, which had been close to my max at the time.

I think that this is because my index finger is not actually engaging when I hang. I am noticing that my index finger doesn’t end up being hyper-extended at the PIP joint when I try to half crimp, and even if I consciously try to put it into that position, it gradually disengages.

Overall, I feel the weight primarily going through my back 3 fingers, and down towards my elbow.

Even though my index finger is still a bit tender in some positions, I’m finding that it doesn’t feel at all uncomfortable while I’m doing the density hangs. While I can “squeeze” the edge with my index finger, something about the wrist or the MCP joint causes me to have a really tough time transferring the weight into my index finger.

Instead, I’ve started experimenting with a much more aggressive 2-finger pull (keeping my feet on the floor).

In this position, I’m finding that my index DIP joint stays hyper-extended, though I have to bend my MCP joint considerably to achieve this. This feels like it hits the injured tissue a lot more.

Furthermore, I feel like I’m actually connecting my index finger with the rest of my forearm, and I can feel the force traveling through a different path when I do this, more on the inside part of my wrist and forearm, rather than the outside.

Instead of doing 6x 30s half-crimp hangs, I am now doing 3x 30s half-crimp hangs, and 3x no-hang 2-finger pulls, trying to develop this more aggressive position. I also reached out to my coach about this to see if he has any further suggestions.

I really hope that I can get the injury to fully go away (I think it’s been about 4-5 weeks since the injury). I’m also hopeful that if I can get my index finger fully engaged it will unlock the crimp for me and help me break through my finger strength plateau.

# the new routine

## 3 gym days

I’ve had a lot less stress since switching to the 3-day-per-week schedule. Even though I feel like I’m doing almost as much stuff as I used to, packing it into just 3 gym days reduces considerable time around scheduling, driving and warming up.

I’m still feeling plenty tired and beat up after my sessions, but having a 2-day rest every week is helping a ton with my recovery as well.

Overall I’m very happy with my decision.

## technique drills

I was really struggling with my “boulder play” sessions during my first 3 cycles, and now I’m doing open/twisting drills, 1-handed climbing, and eliminates instead.

I really like 1-handed climbing drills, and I’ve done them a bunch before in my own training. It’s nice to have some dedicated time to work on that again.

I have to say that the eliminates feel pretty awkward. I’m finding that I definitely have to do them on vert/slab, and definitely have to be strategic about which problems I choose and which holds I eliminate. It’s really easy to turn my warmup technique drill into dyno practice or limit bouldering.

I feel similarly about the open/twisting drill. In some cases forcing a particular movement severely increases the difficulty of the move and I feel like it’s tough to walk that line between practicing movement and trying really hard.

Overall, I really miss the boulder play sessions! I think I might gradually gravitate back there after gaining some inspiration from these more structured ways of getting at technique and coordination practice.

One thing I’m noticing is that I struggle with feeling out-of-control when higher up on the bouldering wall. I’m really curious about exploring that fear and trying to address it during my future technique work.

# consistent but boring vs. flighty but fun

As you probably noticed, I bundled the log into a two-week chunk this time. This is partially because I spent last week [writing about Twitter](https://dlants.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-twitter), and partially because I didn’t really have anything interesting to say.

Part of my motivation for writing this blog was to be boring. I wanted to create something to contrast climbing edutainment — to convey that getting better at climbing is a slow and repetitive process. Lately I’ve been finding cracks in my belief.

When I was programming my own training, I really enjoyed tinkering. I liked examining my weaknesses, experimenting, and coming up with new ways to address holes in my climbing. I guess with the technique drills and my hangboarding, I am feeling an urge to do that again. At the same time, in all that experimenting I missed some pretty obvious holes in my climbing. Focusing on hypertrophy, core and power-endurance in a consistent way has really been paying off.

Thinking ahead to what my own training might look like in the future, I think Lattice has given me a pretty solid foundation. I will definitely be including the “staples” of a max effort day, a power-endurance day and a moderate-difficulty-high-volume day. At the same time, I feel like I want to spice things up with esoteric experimentation - trying to deconstruct my grip and tinkering with finger strength protocols; tuning coordination drills; working on motivation and fear; and coming up with strength challenges.

While I still believe that there are only a few principles underlying effective training (progressive overload, specificity, recovery, etc…), climbing is a multifaceted sport, and so the application of those principles to each individual climber becomes a unique and complex puzzle.

So despite my best efforts, I can’t avoid the conclusion that training for climbing is interesting and fun.
