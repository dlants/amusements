I wasn’t sure about writing this essay - it is a fairly vulnerable thing. I am a cis, straight, white man. I am also anti-racist, and a feminist, and as such I believe that I should interrogate my experience and try to challenge my biases. The alternative would be to expect to be educated by trans, gay, POC, or female feminist thinkers about my own experience and identity, and I think it’s pretty clear to see that this is not an acceptable stance for a feminist.

It was only recently that I realized that when we talk about sex, most of the time we are only talking about male gratification. However, through my experiences with my partners, I’ve learned that sex can mean many things other than that.



High school. Discourse around sex was about how attractive of a partner you could get, and what you could get that partner to do for you.



Porn is almost exclusively about male gratification.



The currency of beauty is often about male gratification. Beautiful women are given things, but only in exchange for their willingness to gratify men. 



The predominant culture is about sex as male gratification. But also men feel entitled to this gratification.



Another thing that fell into place when I understood male gratification was the homophobia of straight men. Straight men seek out gratification from women, and often do so in non-consensual ways. Straight men assume that gay men will act similarly in their search of male gratification. And straight men are deeply uncomfortable with the idea that they would be expected or pressured to sexually gratify another man.



“women can get sex any time”, 

- Rather, women can engage in male gratification any time.
People like to point out that “there are no female incels”, but there are plenty of women who have given up on men. These women want other things from sex, and I don’t think it’s hard to understand that it is extremely difficult to get anything other than male gratification from men.

# What do men trade for their own gratification?

The arrangement of male gratification can create some insecurity. If men are getting gratification from sex, what are their partners getting in return?

For me this was a difficult thing to understand, and made me really insecure about sex. I really wanted gratification, I felt entitled to it, and simultaneously I didn’t really understand why I was getting it.

Men make implicit trades for their gratification - money, status, protection, loyalty. Unfortunately they usually don’t ask their partner about what they actually want from their relationship or from sex.

One example of this is male performance anxiety. Men assume that women want the female equivalent of male gratification. And so they try to deliver it. They trade their physique, obsessing over diet and exercise, inject themselves with steroids and undergo [painful aesthetic surgery](https://youtu.be/QBbsbJZQd9w?si=Xkyj4jFfRBy387V0&t=52). They trade their ability to create a sexual experience for their partner, obsessing over their ability to perform, their penis size, and even risk [penis enlargement surgery](https://www.propublica.org/article/penis-enlargement-enhancement-procedures-implants).

The result for me, and I think for many men, was a constant feeling that I was getting away with something. (an unequal trade). Because the trade was implicit and never agreed upon by my partner, I suspected that it was uneven. I think this feeling is the reason why many men don’t talk to their partners about what they want from sex. Straight men fear that their partners will discover that they are unsatisfied with their relationship.

# Sex beyond male gratification

With experience, I discovered things beyond male gratification that I and my partners want from sex:

- female sexual pleasure
- feeling attractive and desirable
- emotional intimacy
- safety
- connection
- acceptance
Reading media created by straight women and for straight women can also be informative. It is much more often about the emotional content of the couple’s relationship, and the sexual tension and anticipation rather than the sexual act itself. (This is not to say that this is the only thing that all women want, but rather as an example of one thing that some women want).

I have the impulse to fully reject male gratification. Is it entirely an aspect of patriarchy that has been ingrained in me from the time I was little? I think this is a worthy avenue for interrogation, as I do think that much of it is tied up in patriarchal conceptions of self-worth.

> Men come to sex hoping that it will provide them with all of the emotional satisfaction that would have come from love. Most men think that sex will provide them with a sense of being alive, connected, that sex will offer closeness, intimacy, pleasure. And more often than not sex simply does not deliver the goods. This fact does not lead men to cease obsessing about sex; it intensifies their lust and their longing.

 - Bell Hooks, *The Will to Change*

As I continue to disentangle these ideas, I have to admit that male gratification is still something that I want. I am trying to be accepting of that, and recognize that different people want different things from sex. I think engaging in any sexual act is OK as long as it is done with [enthusiastic consent](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent).

For me, this means more candid conversations with my partner about what we both want from our relationship, and from sex. The better we understand about our respective desires, the more we can both get what we want.
