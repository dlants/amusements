Specificity is one of the fundamental principles in any training. Bosch outlines several dimensions of specificity when it comes to designing skill training. The idea here is that if your training is non-specific among these dimensions, it’s unlikely to transfer to performance (climbing harder).



5 dimensions of specificity:

- motor - agility is mostly explosive. What loads, accelerations, angles, etc.. are present in the target movement? We need to train in a similar context. Eccentric (braking) and concentric (accelerating) movement are essentially different skills with regards to transfer. We need to train the eccentric movement (falling) separately.
  - TODO: revisit co-contraction vs chain skills.
  - When operating close to loading limit, the patterns that emerge are different than when operating further away. This is why limit bouldering is so important, and why mileage on easier terrain doesn’t always translate to higher grade skills.
- sensory. What information - environmental and proprioceptive - is present? Height is an important factor. So is gaze location (don’t train falling in situations where you can look at the ground to judge distance and anticipate the landing. Always gaze up at the next hold). Proximity to the wall is an important factor. Practicing on slab is really different than practicing falls away from the wall, since there’s the threat of hitting the slab on the way down. You must practice in a similar environmental context. Close the perception/action loop.
  - perception/action
  - direct perception
- energy / neuromuscular. What are the conditions of fatigue that you will need to perform the skill at? Pay extra attention to neural fatigue. Often the piece that fails first is attention / decision making ability / neural drive. Higher up on the chain than actual energy systems.
- dominant control (central/peripheral)
- intention
# My Reading Notes

p33 - minimum jerk principle, and other principles. Generally, our body tries to minimize stress on the joints and muscles, and to conserve energy and processing power.



p34 - some universal properties. Shoulder joint is most protected at 90degrees. Ab muscles generate force best at a given length, so to use all ab muscles the hips and the shoulders need to be parallel.



p35 - we can override our body’s protective mechanisms through conscious processes (reinvestment theory). A climber choosing to “commit” and push past the discomfort of falling. This sort of behavior leads to injury!



p36 - dealing with degrees of freedom. despite the abundance of degrees of freedom, people tend to move in consistent ways (we all walk, run, use stairs the same way).

Some overlaps with ML: **normalization**. The parameters here are contractive forces. Since we want to minimize fatigue, etc… it makes sense that we would bias less contraction overall. This means biasing larger muscle groups, and also putting the body into positions of high leverage, so that smaller contractions result in more power.

I wonder if there’s also an analogy here having to do with input/output sensitivity, particularly as it relates to the desired movements. That is, in high-leverage positions, a small change in the level of activation of a muscle drives a large change in the output forces. In low leverage positions, large changes in the activation of a muscle drive small changes in the output force.  Depending on how precisely we need to move, we may pick movement strategies that create varying degrees of leverage, in order to exact the appropriate level of precision.

Turvey - “degrees of constraint”



Why don't climbers get better by just climbing? Attractors! Think about falling. Setters in your gym may not set moves that make them fall in a way that is uncomfortable to them. Even if they do, you will likely solve the move a different way, avoiding the uncomfortable fall. Only by describing the space of all possible falls, and purposefully pushing yourself to extend your range, can you develop a more robust falling technique. Hence, CLA. You must figure out ways to restrict yourself to a part of the movement space. The thing that is almost always missing is the middle piece. How do we parametrize the movement space? Math/physics? “techniques”? Attractors!



p44 - since the body is lazy, and tries to go for minimum processing, it will unify various movement strategies into single attractors 



p55 - chunking 



P57 - optimal muscle length



P58 -p60 - co-contraction as a prospective control mechanism. Training co-contraction?! (Ref 72)



p90 specificity, transfer. Transfer between elastic/isometric and concentric/eccentric muscle activation is small.



P91. Activating muscle chains does not transfer to co-contraction.



P94 eccentric - deceleration, concentric - power generation, elastic - power transfer. Should be treated as separate skills with respect to transfer.

Chain action vs co-contraction. Instability challenges co-contraction.

P95. For transfer look at force landscapes. Also make sure to take intensity into account. Short, explosive movements have different force landscapes than slow submaximal movements.

P96. Learning proprioception should start with big explosive movements. You want to amplify the forces to allow the brain to attend to these signals. Maybe for beginners, focusing on dynamic and compy movement is actually beneficial for learning to control their momentum and their body, rather than doing static, delicate or balancey climbing.

P98. Training has to be metabolically specific. There are 4 dominant energy systems: atp, crp, anaerobic and aerobic. We have to load these appropriately during training for transfer to happen.

P98 Neurological fatigue starts happening quickly under tension and may be a significant bottleneck. Sprinter study showed that it was continued ability to control foot strike, rather than diminishing energy output, that causes sprinters to slow down towards the end of the run.

P100 Specificity about where the movement is composed. Are we training an “automated” movement pattern, that happens lower down on the chain of control / closer to the periphery, or an intentional / attention-ful movement, which happens higher up in the brain? Training the wrong way can have negative transfer to your desired outcome on skill. If your athletes always train with explicit/conscious attention to movement, you may degrade automated / peripheral patterns. Specifically for falling practice, this probably means that giving explicit instructions - “keep your knee over your foot, bend at the knee and hip and not your lower back” will not work. Falling from a climb is purely instinctual, and there will likely be no conscious control of the falling movement.

P104 Intention dimension of specificity. Even when the movements are really similar, if the intention behind them is different, they will end up feeling really different to the athlete. I think in terms of falling practice, this translates to what we’re doing before the fall. When training on slab, you should intend to stand up and extend as far up over the foot as you can (and bring your hip as close to the wall as possible). If you do this “anticipating” the fall, then the resulting movement will be quite different, since your intention was different.

P105 “division into dimensions will always be somewhat artificial in a complex system, and its purpose is to make the subject matter methodologically more manageable than to get closer to reality.”
