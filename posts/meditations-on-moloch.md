[Meditations on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) is an essay by Scott Alexander, of Star Slate Codex (and now Astral Codex Ten) fame. Like much of Scott’s writing, it is insightful and provoking. When I initially read the poem and the essay a few years ago, I found it quite hopeless and devastating - a reaction that I suspect is [pretty common](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/y8chm7/anyone_else_affected_in_a_bad_way_by_the/). It made me see the world as extremely fragile.

Moloch became the name for the anxiety that I feel surrounding the destructive forces of the world - capitalism, corruption, the military-industrial complex. Every news story was ultimately about Moloch. Moloch was everywhere. Moloch was coming for me, and the small oases in my life that were not yet touched by its presence.

I think recently my grappling with the idea has brought me to a new place, and a more balanced (dare I say optimistic?) understanding of these ideas.

In his essay, Scott talks through a mental experiment involving rats. Initially the most violent, antisocial rats rule the day. And they are more successful than the artistic and creative rats, and so they reproduce and take over the island. Eventually the rat society breeds out any creativity, leisure or common good.

In this example we see that ultimately, moloch is a product of evolution. And evolution is self-replication - the structures that are the most successful in self-replicating persist. That is the defining force of life.

Moloch is exploitation, but exploitation is self-destructive. Resources that were once abundant, once successfully exploited, will eventually run out. Strategies that are initially effective, once replicated throughout the population, face a new environment and diminishing returns. Exploitation changes the environment, but exploitation cannot change with the environment.

If we continue the rat experiment, we see that as violence becomes more wide-spread, it also faces diminishing returns. Violence against a violent rat is risky. So now we have a new environment, where a new strategy will be more successful. Perhaps you can learn to measure up your opponent and assess the probability of winning the fight - to flee, or intimidate, or bluff. Perhaps you can cooperate with another rat in order to confront a larger opponent - develop mechanisms of building relationships and trust. Perhaps you can discover a new resource that faces less competition, which leads to creativity and adaptability.

Eventually we find that the violent rats are out-competed by rats who exhibit restraint, collaboration and creativity. Moloch is a child of evolution, but so are love, diversity, leisure, and art. And indeed that is what we see in our world.
