We want to exist in a moral world.

Think of the most obvious moral law. Maybe “thou shalt not kill” or “killing people is bad”. This seems on the surface to be straightforward. But it’s easy to push this into the absurd.

What about killing someone in self defense? That’s good. What if someone invades your home and you kill them, but it turns out they were only there to rob the place. Is it OK for a homeowner to be judge, jury and executioner? Is death an acceptable penalty for property crime?

What if you mistakenly think someone has a gun and preemptively shoot them. What if you’re a police officer, and that someone is a black teen?

What about abortion? What about IVF?

What about killing animals to eat? What about killing intelligent animals for sport?



I received an education that gave me this tool. Systematic, logical thought. I can poke holes in arguments. I can poke holes in my own beliefs and positions.



In a way this is a creature of its own. Evolution gave us a part of our brain that is able to execute logic. This part of our brain has allowed us to create logical systems. We can execute the rules of these logical systems, and do this independently of our own brains (though it can be really tough). Multiple people can look at the same idea, apply the rules of the system to it, and come to similar conclusions. (again, in some cases this is challenging, but it seems that we can do it).



And in so doing, we encountered something that is outside of the human experience. I think of it as a separate intelligence that is operating through the hardware of our brains. It has a life of its own. It has rules of its own.



And it is an alien entity. When we try to apply these rules to our daily lives, we inevitably find ourselves in the realm of the absurd.



And perhaps, this entity is something that exists outside of us. The world, and the rules of logic have their conclusions. With our brains we can execute these rules, faultily, and with great collective effort over the passage of time. But if the rules are deterministic, then the world and the logic within it exists in its entirety, outside of time.

With the help of a lot of computation and time, we have gradually discovered larger and larger [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number). But in a way, the prime numbers were always there. From the perspective of the system, what difference does it make if humans find the number in year 1000BC or 2023AD, or if they don’t discover a certain number at all?

The structure that we are discovering with the system is deterministic, and so in a way it exists, complete, outside of human conception and outside of time.



Inevitably, I find myself faced with the fact that our sources of meaning are crude heuristics. They are locally practical but globally meaningless. The fabric of human society is built around patterns that were the most successful at replication (see [[Meditations on Moloch]]). And I can apply this microscope to any part of my experience, and I know that if I zoom in enough, it will dissolve due to scale or self-contradiction.



And it’s a challenge to exist this way. What do you use as a compass? I feel like many people will fall back on religion, or an internal sense of “goodness”. But to me that requires a certain degree of willful ignorance. A decision to not apply the microscope - to not try and dig into and poke holes past a certain level. I personally struggle with this. I feel like I have to work hard not to constantly dissociate from the world. To hang on to relationships, institutions, ideas and meaning as tangible, concrete and real. To avoid putting a magnifying glass to everything in my head and watch it dissolve.



But also, whenever I dissociate, reality always snaps me back into place. Even thought there is a part of my brain that can execute the steps of the logical system and find that life is meaningless, the entirety of me is still very much human. I am still afraid of pain and death. I am wanting of love and compassion. Concerned with my status in society. Invested in being a good person.



There is no global meaning in human experience. But also, there is no global meaning in rejecting the human experience. We cannot fully become the system - we are stuck being human. And even the desire to try to become it, is ultimately human - the desire to transform, to optimize, or to escape uncertainty.



Ultimately I’ve come to the conclusion that I might as well embrace my human experience. I am a walking set of imperfect, local heuristics. The meaning of my life is to do my best to navigate the world using these heuristics.



Also, in a way this perspective is freeing. Whenever a heuristic doesn’t work, I know that this is expected. They are imperfect, after all.
