# proximal-to-distal, distal-to-proximal

Most climbers default to generating force by pulling. We should also be able to generate from our feet and from our hips. From Udo Neumann, he talks about it in this [power company podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmM2IbmMGk4&list=PLMWkOymNVl2Vk2gEdhup7hKk23mcSfe2T&index=1).

# force dissipation

Udo Neumann talks about this in this [power company podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmM2IbmMGk4&list=PLMWkOymNVl2Vk2gEdhup7hKk23mcSfe2T&index=1). He talks about “transparency” of joints. Mentions an exercise he did during dance where they were doing lunges on the floor, and focusing on absorbing the force of the lunge through all of their joints.

I think Janja Garnbret is particularly good at this - as witnessed by her insane ability to stick barndoor moves via the “Janja flick”.

# deadpoint / time over feet / making time

I think most folks know what a deadpoint is. The idea is to generate upward momentum and time the move at the apex of the arc of your body, to catch that moment of “floating”

I got the “time over feet” concept from [Ross Fulkerson](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ClWB4gNB1T8). I think it’s a similar idea, but applied in a different dimension. You’re trying to create the floating point over feet, in your hips, in a dynamic move, or sometimes even [over presses](https://youtu.be/gdXCVpLI5uo?si=gq40-HuH66N8miEb&t=507).

I think this generalizes into a concept of “manipulating momentum to create time”, which is needed especially for complex coordination moves or moves that require precision. The more hover time you can make, the easier it is to find the appropriate holds and position.

# commitment / anticipating the fall / extension

Udo Neumann talks about basketball being a great transfer sport for climbing because it teaches you to fully extend - for example when taking a three-pointer shot, or jumping for a rebound.

He also talks about the negative side of this - our bodies aren’t used to falling. So on many moves, we “prepare” for the fall by dropping our feet underneath us instead of fully extending and committing to the move. [[ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1934wS3J44&t=2624s)]

The desirable movement pattern here is to continue to press through the feet through the entirety of the move, and to fully extend while going for the next hold.

## falling / landing

Once I started thinking about falling and falling practice, I started paying more attention to how pro climbers fall in competitions. One thing I quickly realized is that they are comfortable taking the fall in any direction, including face-first.

A lot of the time they will use their shoulder or elbows to dissipate some momentum during their landing. I think this is potentially a really great thing for climbers to train - how to land on their side, on their front, with twisting momentum. Especially landing “head first” where you have to roll or use an elbow or a shoulder to redirect momentum away from your head.

Parallels with sparring in combat sports? Parallels with tackling in contact sports? (try and find the talent equation podcast I listened to about this).

# anticipating the contact point

Janja is particularly good at this. While she’s in-flight during a dynamic move, she is relaxed. However, when she’s just about to land, she tenses up and anticipates the landing. From [this episode of the power company podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmM2IbmMGk4&list=PLMWkOymNVl2Vk2gEdhup7hKk23mcSfe2T&index=1).

# bilateral bias

Udo Neumann talks about this in this [power company podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmM2IbmMGk4&list=PLMWkOymNVl2Vk2gEdhup7hKk23mcSfe2T&index=1). This has to do with the fact that we’re more comfortable exploring / trying / moving with our dominant side. We should be sure that we can do every move on the non-dominant side as well.



# slab?

What allows Orianne to breezily walk up slabs like this? Sensitivity to hip position?
