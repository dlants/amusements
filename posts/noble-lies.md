I read a book once about the criminal justice system which posited a similar conundrum - you want to punish the behavior, but you can really only punish the outcome. So like, lots of people use their phones while driving. If you use your phone while driving and crash into someone (or worse, kill someone), you will get punished severely. But really the behavior you're doing is not any worse than any of the other people who drive distracted.

So should a cop who sees someone looking at their phone while driving punish them with some degree of negligent homicide? Or should folks who actually crash and kill people get only a ticket?

This seems like a fundamental absurdity, doesn't it? We want to punish the *behavior* (distracted driving), but we can really only punish the *outcome* (causing harm). The behavior itself isn't any worse than what thousands of other people do daily without consequence.

## The Moral Luck Problem

Philosophers and legal scholars call this the "moral luck" problem. It's the uncomfortable truth that factors outside our control dramatically affect how we're judged and punished. Two people can engage in identical negligent behavior, but face wildly different consequences based purely on chance.

Our legal system tries to balance multiple competing values: deterring dangerous behavior before harm occurs, proportionally punishing outcomes based on severity, acknowledging the role of intent and negligence, and addressing victims' need for justice. But it never fully resolves the fundamental contradiction.

Legal scholars and philosophers like Thomas Nagel have written extensively about how our sense of justice seems to require that moral responsibility depend solely on factors within a person's control. Yet our actual practices of blame and punishment are deeply affected by factors outside that control.

I've come to think that perfect fairness isn't necessarily an achievable goal of the criminal justice system, though it remains an aspirational one. The system makes practical compromises rather than pursuing perfect theoretical consistency. Judges and legal scholars are generally aware of this philosophical tension, even as they work within a system that doesn't completely resolve it.

## Working Within Contradiction

This creates a strange cognitive dissonance for people who work within the criminal justice system. Judges, prosecutors, and lawmakers must navigate a system that, when examined closely, contains fundamental philosophical contradictions. How do they square this circle?

From what I've learned, many professionals in the field adopt a pragmatic approach. They acknowledge the inherent contradictions while believing in the system's overall value. They recognize the impossibility of perfect fairness or pure objectivity, but still work to reduce harm and increase justice within an inherently imperfect system.

Some judges adopt philosophical pragmatism, recognizing that legal judgments involve human discretion that can never be perfectly consistent. They focus on practical outcomes rather than theoretical perfection.

But here's what I find fascinating: almost none of them acknowledge these contradictions publicly.

## The Noble Lie of Justice

This brings us to what philosophers since Plato have called the "noble lie" - simplified narratives society maintains that, while not strictly true, serve important social purposes.

The public-facing rhetoric about justice systems almost universally portrays them as fair, impartial, and consistent. We get slogans about "blind justice" and "equality before the law" while the system's internal participants often recognize the messy, contradictory reality.

Why maintain this fiction? Because the system requires public buy-in to function. If citizens widely believed the system was fundamentally arbitrary, compliance and cooperation would collapse. The rhetoric around "blind justice" might be viewed not as describing current reality but as articulating an ideal to strive toward.

There's also the psychological toll on decision-makers. For judges making life-altering decisions, constantly acknowledging the system's contradictions would be psychologically devastating. Some level of belief in the system's value becomes necessary to function.

I have a hard time imagining being a judge while being aware of this fact. It's difficult to convict someone of involuntary manslaughter when you know there are millions of people doing the exact same thing daily, and still feel like you're being "proportional to the act."

## The Public Perception Bargain

This phenomenon isn't unique to the justice system. Politicians, doctors, teachers, and other public-facing professionals all navigate similar tensions between messy reality and simplified public narratives.

These professionals make a kind of bargain: they present simplified, idealized versions of their institutions while internally grappling with contradictions and limitations. They champion a simplified view of the world that large groups can grasp and accept, even while personally acknowledging a more complex reality.

Is this evil? In some ways, it feels dishonest. Yet perhaps it's just the natural outcome of the constraints of human social systems. Large groups struggle with nuance and ambiguity. Simplified narratives that people can rally around serve crucial social functions.

There seems to be a certain bargain here - if you're convinced that a certain public perception of justice is important, you have a moral obligation to act and perform to satisfy that perception, even though it may be a false one. It almost feels like a deal with the devil. The group is not really capable of reacting to nuance or subtlety, so professionals must accept this bargain: simplify and publicly champion a simplified view of the world.

## Finding Meaning in Absurdity

Albert Camus, reflecting on the inherent absurdity of human existence, suggested that finding meaning requires lucid acknowledgment of this absurdity. Perhaps the same applies to our justice system.

For me, the approach to having a more psychologically cohesive mindset would be to recognize that the justice system is ultimately an absurd system and is inherently contradictory, but so is all of human existence in some way. I would look at it from the point of view that this is a thing that is serving a function - the public perception of that thing is part of that function - and ultimately take on some form of a utilitarian argument. I would promote and stand by the system in the public sphere to the degree necessary for it to continue to function. But internally, I would struggle with believing that this was genuine. I would see it as part of my job and as a performative act that was necessary for the system to function.

The most intellectually honest stance might be to acknowledge the system's inherent contradictions while still working to reduce harm and increase justice within its constraints. Rather than pretending these contradictions don't exist, we might accept them as inevitable features of human institutions.

This perspective - serving a functional role while maintaining internal awareness of a system's absurdities - might be the most intellectually honest position. Rather than blindly believing in an impossible ideal or rejecting the system entirely, it accepts that human institutions, like human existence itself, involve irresolvable contradictions we must nevertheless navigate.

What do you think? Are there other fundamental contradictions in our social systems that we collectively ignore? How do you reconcile working within systems that contain philosophical contradictions?
