This is a call for an investigation, and a criticism of, the SFUSD de-tracking initiative from the political group Families of San Francisco.

It criticizes the evidence presented by SFUSD about the effectiveness of their de-tracking policies on three points:

Overall, I think the criticism is valid. It does seem like SFUSD was jumping at the opportunity to make themselves look good, even if that meant omitting important context to make evidence look more convincing than it actually was.

However, I think the report itself is also biased / flawed. There's some [[FUD]] here.
