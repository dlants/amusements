I've been volunteering with a summer internship program for high school students lately. One of the students, (let’s call him “Alex”), was interested in getting better at math, so he agreed to let me tutor him, and I've been using the Amplify Desmos Math curriculum.

We started by jumping around and I did a few readiness check activities from various units to assess where he was at. Through this we discovered that Alex (like many students) gets really mixed up about when to add or subtract numbers, and when to multiply vs divide.

So I had him do some reasoning about area ([Letters](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/6029e269b470d50d96ac4b8e?collections=5fff36c7a65b820b3c57bc64%2C5fff83548b9eb944c93914ec) and [Shapes on a Plane](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/6024150c9d444a3377f6ea6a?collections=5fff36c7a65b820b3c57bc64%2C5fff83548b9eb944c93914ec)) to build some intuition around area, multiplication and addition. Today we started taking a closer look at positive and negative numbers and the number line via [Floats and Anchors](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5f063f080945156c5d03c87d?collections=5f8a43db06b0d9a8bd84c3cf%2C5f8a446e06b0d9a8bd84c3dd). I think we've hit a really fruitful area for exploration, so I am having him work through a few activities from [grade 6 positive and negative numbers unit](https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5fff2b39b97f313126e0f531?collections=5fff36c7a65b820b3c57bc64) to get exposed to a variety of contexts before returning to building a more abstract understanding in [the grade 7 unit](https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5f8a446e06b0d9a8bd84c3dd?collections=5f8a43db06b0d9a8bd84c3cf).

I've been working on the technology behind [teacher.desmos.com](http://teacher.desmos.com/) for almost a decade now, but this is the first time I got to use it in a context like this. It’s been an utter delight. I can see the depth of experience and the careful design behind each and every screen. As Alex reasons through the activities, I get incredible insight into his thought processes and the boundaries of his understanding. It feels like I have a special math x-ray that lets me see into his brain. Also, the curriculum feels incredibly human. It’s like I have an expert teacher watching over my shoulder. I am consistently positioned right at the boundary of Alex’s understanding, and am given many opportunities to guide him in just the right direction.



In the beginning of the internship, Alex didn’t respond to my intro email. I had to ask some folks from the program to check in with him to get him to show up. In our first video call, he was 10 minutes late. He wouldn’t turn his camera on, and gave one-word answers to all of my questions. He was obviously distracted, and kept disappearing from the call.

Before the second call, my wife Nora (who taught for 5 years) encouraged me to set some boundaries. This was deeply uncomfortable for me. I felt really disrespected, and my impulse was to go with the “tough love” route and demand respect. At the same time, I felt conflicted about those feelings, because I’ve been disengaged in similar ways to Alex when I was younger and toughness was really not what I needed back then.

In our second meeting, I told Alex that it felt really frustrating to me when he was late and didn’t engage. I wanted to support him through the internship program, and in order to do that I needed to get to know him and understand his context. I could accomplish that better if I could see his face and have his attention and engagement for the hour that I saw him each week.

I expected that this wouldn’t work right away, but resolved myself to just keep trying to reach out and engage. To my surprise, Alex responded positively right away. We ended up having a great conversation that day, and continued in the following weeks.

Alex is a kid who really liked math in elementary school but feels really rejected by it now. He barely passed his high school math graduation requirement. We talked about what math felt like (in Alex’s experience confusing, alienating). We talked about what it meant to be good at math (for Alex, being willing to put up with boredom, confusion and frustration).

We also talked about motivation in this and other parts of his life. We connected over sports - Alex is an avid soccer player, and is someone who really enjoys challenging himself in that domain. He is also feeling really nervous about his college prospects, and wants to find stable employment to support himself and his family. This is what eventually led us to tutoring - he wants to get into a good college, and his math grades are the biggest obstacle standing in his way.

It took about 5 weekly meetings before he agreed to give tutoring a try. He’s willing to try this thing because of the relationship we’ve developed. When he told me about his negative view of math, I didn’t judge him or deny his feelings. The experiences that he’s had in math class genuinely suck. I think validating this experience was what led him to trust me when I said that math didn’t have to feel that way.



I think Alex really enjoys our tutoring sessions. He’s engaged, he’s willing to think out loud. He makes mistakes and tells me what he’s thinking. He’s willing to be vulnerable and I am very conscious of how valuable and fragile that vulnerability is.

I also know that our curriculum is a safe context to be vulnerable. We care more about what Alex does right than what he does wrong. We take his partially formed ideas and reflect them back, encouraging him to grow, rather than just labeling those ideas as incorrect. We’re not going to bore him with 30 repetitions of the same thing.



So in sum, I’m really proud of our technology. We have so much flexibility in how we can represent and elicit student thinking. We have tools to interpret what students are thinking and reflect that thinking back to them in a rich and interactive way.

I am, as always, impressed by our content team and the curriculum that they create - the depth of expertise and care that’s reflected in it.

This experience also reminded me that these are not the most important things about what we do. Kids like Alex won’t get to benefit from any of our stuff if they aren’t in a context that allows them to engage with it in a vulnerable and positive way. Creating positive relationships with math, with each other, and with ourselves is what it’s really about.

I feel really proud that we are a team that is aware of that. That we strive to embed this understanding in our platform and curriculum, in our coaching and PD, and in our communication around marketing and sales.

So today I’m feeling grateful for all of you, the work we do, and for getting a chance to experience this in my life.
