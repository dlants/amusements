Hey! My name is Denis Lantsman. I’ve done some cool things in my technology career:

- Machine Learning and Search Quality Engineering
- Full-Stack Software Engineering
- Implementing a browser-native [Domain Specific Language](https://teacher.desmos.com/computation-layer/documentation) for building [interactive math experiences](https://programguide.desmosmath.amplify.com/), and a supporting integrated development environment.
- Infrastructure / Dev-Ops
- Developing hiring processes, mentoring, and shaping an awesome engineering team.


These days I work on building [teacher.desmos.com](https://teacher.desmos.com/).



I’m interested in many things!

- 💪🏻 I’m an avid climber (boulderer), and I really enjoy learning about the science of sports and skill acquisition, and applying it to my training. My favorite resources are the [perception and action podcast](https://perceptionaction.com/), [strongerbyscience](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/), and especially their [art and science of lifting books](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/art-and-science/).
- 🔪 Cooking. I love learning from folks like [Kenji](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/) and [Internet Shaquille](https://www.youtube.com/@internetshaquille).
- 🐕 Dog training. I have a very smart, but also very challenging dog. I got really into dog training while trying to figure out ways for us to coexist. I really love [Hannah Branigan’s work](https://hannahbranigan.dog/).
- 🕳️ Absurdism / existentialism. Though I prefer to find humor in it, like [Rational Funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOTZttTVEqY).
- 📝 Self-evidently, I enjoy writing.


The whole point of this blog is to [create a community](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-blog-is-the-engine-of-community). Each post is like a message in a bottle, floating in the ocean (oSEOan ?), waiting to be found. So if you connected with anything in this blog, please treat me with a note. I’ll find it very reinforcing.
